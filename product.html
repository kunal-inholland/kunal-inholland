        <h3>VRWorkout</h3>
      </header>
      With this new virtual reality music workout game, you will get an intense full-body workout
      that is on par with other
      calisthenics exercises. This VR game is much more engaging than others like Beat Saber and Box VR, since it
      involves
      more muscle groups by mixing up standing, squatting, pushups, side planks, crunches, jumping and burpees.

        <h3>What problem does it solve?</h3>
      </header>
      This game makes working out a fun activity. Working out doesn't have to be a chore. Turn up the music and get
      moving with
      a fitness game that uses motion tracking. See your progress as you go, and work on your technique to improve your
      score.
      This can be a great way to stay motivated and enjoy your workout, without getting bored. The only downside is that
      you
      need a VR headset and enough space to move around without hitting anything.

        <h3>How to use this?</h3>
      </header>
      In order to use VRWorkout, you will need a virtual reality headset that has at least two motion trackers for your
      hands.
      The Oculus Quest is the recommended headset for this game, as it can be used wirelessly. To get started, simply
      download
      the free game from Steam or the Quest Store. At first, working out in VR may cause nausea, but this will dissipate
      with
      time and eventually become enjoyable.

        <h3>VR workout on the internet</h3>
      </header>
      Virtual reality has become a popular way to workout, with many people sharing their experiences on YouTube. One of
      those
      people is Ryan Trahan, who completed a 30 day challenge where he played different workout games in VR every day.
      In the
      span of those 30 days, he lost 3.5 kilos and got his body into much better shape. This proves the effectiveness of
      VR
      Workout. VR Workout paired with a good diet is definitely the most fun way to bring your body back in shape.
